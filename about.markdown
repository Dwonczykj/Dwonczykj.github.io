My name is Joey and I have spent the last couple years building <i>temporary</i> financial freedom.
<br/>
I am now working to build a system that sees Supermarkets increase volume of sustainable product sales whilst maintaining profitability and progressively increasing ESG ratings for years to come. This system is the most critical step in obtaining mass adoption of sustainable practices across our society. It allows consumers and suppliers combined to quickly and actively switch to more sustainable practices immediately as opposed to waiting on governments to act whom find it difficult to act as quickly unless in a state of emergency.
