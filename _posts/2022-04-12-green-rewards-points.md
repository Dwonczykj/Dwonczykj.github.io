As most are already aware, a large problem facing our society today is how to be more sustainable and *importantly*, how society can achieve this quickly.

## What does it mean to become more sustainable?
There is no **singular** definition because different parts of the world emphasize different practices, are affected by differing environmental issues and have differing societal challenges to overcome. But in general, it can be thought of as practices that preserve the health of the planet, its ecosystems and our societies **for future generations**. 

## How is this relevant to me?
One way that we all have a size-able impact on the environment is through our grocery shop. Key factors that determine the sustainability of the shop are:

- The choice of store, (some offer more sustainable products than others)
- Choice of items, some have a lower cost to the environment
- How we get the items from store to home
- Do we re-use shopping bags and recycle old packaging & sacks as directed by manufacturers?

Groceries play a large role in determining our collective environmental impact. 

With that in mind, it makes sense to discuss the criteria that determine which groceries we buy.

## What can I buy and why

For the majority of us, the largest, most dominating consideration when choosing which products to buy is price.

1. Does the cost of the product fit into my daily, weekly budget?
2. Or is the product reduced? If so how much; is it worth it?

On the other hand, for the minority of us, the criteria are very different:

1. Is the product organic / sustainably sourced?
![Sustainably sourced labels](/assets/images/SustainablySourcedSupermarketItemLabels.jpeg){: .center }
2. Does the product contain potentially harmful chemicals for our environment when used / disposed of?
3. Does a certain percentage of every purchase of that product fund a good cause; perhaps health care, a charity, an initiative in our schools...

The reason that these criteria can't all be met together is, ***in general***, products that tick the latter 3 points on sustainability and benefits to society simply cost more to manufacture and therefore to buy. This sadly, then rules them out of most shopping baskets for the majority of the population for which price is the biggest consideration.

    <p>Can the trade-off between sustainability and price be reversed such that one improves the other?</p>
  </div>
</div>

Any solution must incentivise customers, for whom **price** is the biggest consideration, by giving them the option to choose products that maximize <span style="color: green"><b>benefit to our society</b></span>, minimize the impact on our environment; all whilst satisfying their budgetary constraints. 
## Rewards schemes

Rewards schemes have existed in the retail industry for decades. They have the benefit of being both: simple to account for from the retailer's point of view as well as being easily recognizable from the point of view of the customer.

## Checkout üé¨

When paying for groceries, customers receive a receipt of purchase. With a <span style="color: green"><b>green points rewards scheme</b></span> in place, each item will display: not only its price, but also the number of green points awarded for buying that item.

## Would all items earn green points?

**No**!

Unsustainable products **must** be removed from shopping baskets **ASAP** in order to transition towards sustainable living practices as quickly as possible. Without action, further, more significant damage will be done to the lives of future generations. Therefore it must be possible for consumers to take these actions. This evidences the need for a <span style="color: green"><b>green points rewards scheme</b></span>.

## Calculating reward size

The <span style="color: green"><b>green rewards points</b></span> are awarded to customers based on:

- the environmental impact of the product
- the supply chain impact of the product
- the benefit to society from each sale of the product

Additional <span style="color: green"><b>green rewards points</b></span> would also be rewarded for further sustainable actions such as:

- re-using shopping bags,
- re-using fruit & veg sacks where possible,
- using products like [Loop](https://www.tescoplc.com/sustainability/taking-action/environment/packaging/our-partnership-with-loop/) (partnered with Tescos) that further reduce an individual's footprint and actively move society in the direction of a 100% circular economy.

## Valuing green rewards points

Green rewards points will have a value equivalent to an amount of money, for example <span class="money">¬£ 0.01</span>. 

By having a monetary value, consumers acquire a *real* increase in disposable income in stores that offer <span style="color: green"><b>green rewards points</b></span>. The points rewards would both:
- increase volume of sustainable products sold in these stores
- make sustainable products affordable for more consumers

# Closing words
In this article, I have discussed one possible action plan to achieve a rapid transition towards more sustainable supermarket shopping practices. To begin, retailers must take the first step by adopting a <span style="color: green"><b>green rewards points</b></span> to give consumers the choice to act more sustainably.
