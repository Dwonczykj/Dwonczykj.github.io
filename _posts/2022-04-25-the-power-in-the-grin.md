Smiling is an expression not an emotion. It is just as much an action as a reaction. It can be used to communicate warmth as well as to signal a warning. The smile is a versatile tool in the social tool box that we might unknowingly neglect. In this article, I would like to both educate and persuade you on the pros of that cheesy grin! üòÅ

## Who?

This post isn't aimed at those of us who are already smiling because their life is sick, unless you yourself are in fact smiling right now thanks to the nature of this post. 

If you are naturally an unconscious smirker, someone constantly projecting a grin like a cheshire cat, fantastic; you might still find the **Why?** discussed below in this article of interest, but if not, then this article is absolutely written for you.

## Why?

![5 reasons to smile pie diagram](/assets/images/power-of-grin-piediagram.jpeg){: .center }

1. **Increases confidence**: the more we smile, the more others will instinctively smile back at us, making us both feel great, be more inviting, become more confident and likely, cause us to smile even more.
2. Reason two is subtly different, but important to distinguish from reason one above. Choosing to smile makes us more **proactive with our emotions**, we choose them as opposed to accepting our emotions in reaction to our surroundings. Ever remember being told to do homework at school and thinking "*I'll do it when I want to not, not when you tell me to*"; or how about when someone told you to calm down, clearly demonstrating the emotional intelligence of a pebble....; the consequences for that pebble were probably justified on that day üòâ. 
Smiling is the same, but instead of your surroundings dictating to you, take control and the put the grin to use! Obviously not all situations allow for a smirk and in some cases, it's just inappropriate, but in general, the world is better if you take that cheesy grin out of the locker. <span style="color: green;">Action: try regularly actioning a smile for 2 whole days and see how you feel, my money's on invincible.</span>
1. **Neuroplasticity**: If our brain, is constantly learning, changing and rebuilding from our actions, our environment, our reactions, then when we smile, we are learning to be look happy and almost trick ourselves into being happy whatever the situation. Cool!
2. **Boosts immune system** & health in general to be better able to fight off illnesses and whatever other stresses you put your body through:
    1. life
    2. work
    3. fitness
    4. family
    5. sport
    6. ...
3. Combined with the above, smiling **lowers stress** and its effects are cumulatively beneficial the more days of proactively smiling that you achieve. If stress is one of the largest contributors to unhappiness, fatigue or weight issues in your life, then smiling on its own may be part of the solution.

## When?

1. @ the first person you see every day
2. @ the friends and colleagues you see most days
3. Or; got 0 mates? Try mirror mirror on the wall. It sounds and perhaps is ridiculous, but seeing yourself with that cheesy grin works just as well.

## Wrapping up

What have we discussed? Cheesy grins get the win and the effects are instant! Give them a go...
