As most are already aware, a large problem facing our society today is how to be more sustainable and *importantly*, how can society achieve this quickly.

### What does it mean to become more sustainable
There is no **singular** definition because different parts of the world emphasize different practices, are affected by differing environmental issues and have differing societal challenges to overcome. But in general, it can be thought of practices that preserve the health of the planet, it's ecosystems and our societies **for future generations**. 

One way that we all have a size-able impact on the environment is through our grocery shop. Key factors that determine the sustainability of the shop are:

- The choice of store, (some offer more sustainable products than others)
- Choice of items, some have a lower cost to the environment
- How we get the items from store to home
- Do we re-use shopping bags and recycle old packaging & sacks as labelled?

Groceries play a large role in determining our collective environmental impact. With that in mind, it makes sense to discuss the criteria that determine which groceries we buy.

For the majority of us, the largest, most dominating consideration when choosing which products to buy is price.

1. Does the cost of the product fit into my daily, weekly budget?
2. Or is the product reduced? If so how much; is it worth it?

On the other hand, for a minority in our society, the criteria are very different:

1. Is the product organic / sustainably sourced?
![Sustainably sourced labels](/assets/images/SustainablySourcedSupermarketItemLabels.jpeg){: .center }
2. Does the product contain potentially harmful chemicals for our environment when used / disposed of?
3. Does a certain percentage of every purchase of that product fund a good cause; perhaps health care, a charity, an initiative in our schools...

Currently, the reason that these criteria can't all be met together is, ***in general***, products that tick the latter 3 points on sustainability and benefits to society simply cost more to manufacture and therefore to buy. This sadly, then rules them out of most shopping baskets for the majority of the population for which price is the biggest consideration.

So how can we flip this relationship on it's head?

How can we start to incentivize customers, for whom **price** is the biggest consideration, to give them the option to choose products that offer the <style="color:green"><b>most benefit to our society</b></style> and which are the <style="color:green"><b>most sustainable</b></style>?

What if there was a way that we could use a rewards scheme to create this scenario?

This would have the benefit of being simple to account for from the point of view of the retailer as well as be simple to understand from the point of view of the customer.

## Action ðŸŽ¬

Imagine yourself doing your grocery shop in store, online or as and when needed on the way back from work. However you do your shop, when you pay for your groceries you get a receipt of purchase. With the addition of a <style="color:green"><b>green points rewards scheme</b></style>, the receipt would contain the following:

- cost of each item
- number of <style="color:green"><b>green rewards points</b></style> rewarded for each item


## Calculating the number of green points to award

The <style="color:green"><b>green rewards points</b></style> are awarded to the customer based on:

- the environmental impact of the product
- the supply chain impact for that product
- the benefit to society from each sale of that product

Additional <style="color:green"><b>green rewards points</b></style> would also be rewarded for additional sustainable choices such as:

- using your own bags,
- using fruit & veg sacks where possible,
- for using products like [Loop](https://www.tescoplc.com/sustainability/taking-action/environment/packaging/our-partnership-with-loop/) (partnered with Tescos) to further reduce an individuals foot print and actively move towards a 100% circular economy
